<p>Hello! My name is Monica, and I am currently in process of applying to my masters in Computer Science and Data Science. 
<br>
  <p>I graduated from Pepperdine University with my Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration. During that time, I took several computer science
    classes, which is how I came to love programming.
  <p> I am currently very interested in artificial intelligence, and would love to focus my future CS studies in this field.
